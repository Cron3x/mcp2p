# mcp2p

The Idea:
    Building a Mod wich can open a lanworld to the _internet_ by using Peer-to-Peer and a method called hole punching.
    
    How could it look?
        mcp2p start <PORT>
            -> returns an id  u use for connecting to server ( 1.1.1.1:8080;password)
        mcp2p con 1.1.1.1:8080;password

Current State:
    - concept work

Only use this with people you trust, it will be posible to see the IP address of erveryone connected to the server
